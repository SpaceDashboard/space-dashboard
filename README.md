Space Dashboard is an open-source web app that provides real-time and historical data on space events, such as solar activity, planetary K indices, upcoming launches, near-Earth objects, and live feeds from the International Space Station. Its goal is to offer enthusiasts and professionals an easy-to-navigate platform for monitoring space data in a visually entertaining way.
