Space Dashboard is an open-source web app that provides real-time and historical data on space events, such as solar activity, planetary K indices, upcoming launches, near-Earth objects, and live feeds from the International Space Station. Its goal is to offer enthusiasts and professionals an easy-to-navigate platform for monitoring space data in a visually entertaining way.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpaceDashboard/space-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and run locally:

   ```

## Usage

Once the app is running locally, users can view real-time space data, configure their dashboard, and interact with details of various panels. All settings changes are made to the browser's localStorage, not on any server, and never connected to anyone via Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
